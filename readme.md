[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/44ef465e-22c0-49eb-8aaf-8612ba40b4be/2971664/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/rvanvenetie-66/spacetime)

In this project, we attempt to compute numerical solutions of linear parabolic 
PDEs, with the heat equation being the main example. Our goal is to solve these
equations in the lowest possible computational complexity. For this, we implement
a space-time variational formulation of the PDE at hand, with a wavelet basis in
the temporal direction and finite elements in the spatial direction.

The project is still under development.

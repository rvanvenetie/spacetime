abstract = {We design and analyze an adaptive {\$}hp{\$}-finite element method (hp-AFEM) in dimensions {\$}n=1,2{\$}. The algorithm consists of iterating two routines: hp-NEARBEST finds a near-best {\$}hp{\$}-approximation of the current discrete solution and data to a desired accuracy, and REDUCE improves the discrete solution to a finer but comparable accuracy. The former hinges on a recent algorithm by Binev for adaptive {\$}hp{\$}-approximation, and acts as a coarsening step. We prove convergence and instance optimality.},

abstract = {The abstract linear parabolic evolution equation is formulated as a well-posed linear operator equation for which a conforming minimal residual Petrov–Galerkin discretization framework is developed: the approximate solution is defined as the minimizer of a suitable functional residual over the discrete test space, and may be obtained numerically from an equivalent algebraic residual minimization problem. This approximate solution is shown to be well defined and to converge quasi-optimally in the natural norm if the discrete trial and test spaces are stable, i.e., if the discrete inf–sup condition is satisfied with a uniform positive lower bound. For the parabolic operator we devise an abstract criterion for the stability of pairs of space–time trial and test spaces, and construct hierarchic families of trial and test spaces of a sparse space–time tensor-product type that satisfy this criterion. The theory is applied to the concrete example of the diffusion equation and is illustrated numerically.},

abstract = {Four classes of eigenvalue problems that admit similar min-max principles and the Cauchy interlacing inequalities as the symmetric eigenvalue problem famously does are investigated. These min-max principles pave ways for efficient numerical solutions for extreme eigenpairs by optimizing the so-called Rayleigh quotient functions. In fact, scientists and engineers have already been doing that for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hermitian matrix pencils A AB with B being positive definite, the first class of our eigenvalue problems. But little attention has gone to the other three classes: positive semidefinite pencils, linear response eigenvalue problems, and hyperbolic eigenvalue problems, in part because most min-max principles for the latter were discovered only very recently and some more are being discovered. It is expected that they will drive the effort to design better optimization based numerical methods for years to come.},

The adaptation is based on equilibrated flux estimates. These estimates are presented here for inhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, for spatially varying polynomial degree, and for mixed rectangular-triangular grids possibly containing hanging nodes. They deliver a global error upper bound with constant one and, up to data oscillation, error lower bounds on element patches with a generic constant dependent only on the mesh regularity and with a computable bound.

abstract = {Offering the only existing finite element (FE) codes for Maxwell equations that support hp refinements on irregular meshes, Computing with hp-ADAPTIVE FINITE ELEMENTS: Volume 1. One- and Two-Dimensional Elliptic and Maxwell Problems presents 1D and 2D codes and automatic hp adaptivity. This self-contained source discusses the theory and implementation of hp-adaptive FE methods, focusing on projection-based interpolation and the corresponding hp-adaptive strategy. The book is split into three parts, progressing from simple to more advanced problems. Part I examines the hp elements for the standard 1D model elliptic problem. The author develops the variational formulation and explains the construction of FE basis functions. The book then introduces the 1D code (1Dhp) and automatic hp adaptivity. This first part ends with a study of a 1D wave propagation problem. In Part II, the book proceeds to 2D elliptic problems, discussing two model problems that are slightly beyond standard-level examples: 3D axisymmetric antenna problem for Maxwell equations (example of a complex-valued, indefinite problem) and 2D elasticity (example of an elliptic system). The author concludes with a presentation on infinite elements - one of the possible tools to solve exterior boundary-value problems. Part III focuses on 2D time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The book explains the construction of the hp edge elements and the fundamental de Rham diagram for the whole family of hp discretizations. Next, it explores the differences between the elliptic and Maxwell versions of the 2D code, including automatic hp adaptivity. Finally, the book presents 2D exterior (radiation and scattering) problems and sample solutions using coupled hp finite/infinite elements.},

abstract = {Adaptive finite element methods (AFEM) are a fundamental numerical in-strument in science and engineering to approximate partial differential equations. In the 1980s and 1990s a great deal of effort was devoted to the design of a posteriori error estimators, following the pioneering work of Babu{\v{s}}ka. These are computable quantities, depending on the discrete solution(s) and data, that can be used to assess the approximation quality and improve it adaptively. Despite their practical success, adaptive processes have been shown to converge, and to exhibit optimal cardinal-ity, only recently for dimension d {\textgreater} 1 and for linear elliptic PDE. These series of lectures presents an up-to-date discussion of AFEM encompassing the derivation of upper and lower a posteriori error bounds for residual-type estimators, including a critical look at the role of oscillation, the design of AFEM and its basic prop-erties, as well as a complete discussion of convergence, contraction property and quasi-optimal cardinality of AFEM.},

abstract = {First-order system least squares (FOSLS) is a recently developed methodology for solving partial differential equations. Among its advantages are that the finite element spaces are not restricted by the inf-sup condition imposed, for example, on mixed methods and that the least-squares functional itself serves as an appropriate error measure. This paper studies the FOSLS approach for scalar second-order elliptic boundary value problems with discontinuous coefficients, irregular boundaries, and mixed boundary conditions. A least-squares functional is defined, and ellipticity is established in a natural norm of an appropriately scaled least-squares bilinear form. For some geometries, this ellipticity is independent of the size of the jumps in the coefficients. The occurrence of singularities at interface corners, cross points, reentrant corners, and irregular boundary points is discussed, and a basis of singular functions with local support around singular points is established. A companion paper shows that the singular basis functions can be added at little extra cost and lead to optimal performance of standard finite element discretization and multilevel solver techniques, also independent of the size of coefficient jumps for some geometries. {\textcopyright} 2005 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {We describe a parallel solver for the discretized weakly singular space-time boundary integral equation of the spatially two-dimensional heat equation. The global space-time nature of the system matrices leads to improved parallel scalability in distributed memory systems in contrast to time-stepping methods where the parallelization is usually limited to spatial dimensions. We present a parallelization technique which is based on a decomposition of the input mesh into submeshes and a distribution of the corresponding blocks of the system matrices among processors. To ensure load balancing, the distribution is based on a cylic decomposition of complete graphs. In addition, the solution of the global linear system requires the use of an efficient preconditioner. We present a robust preconditioning strategy which is based on boundary integral operators of opposite order, and extend the introduced parallel solver to the preconditioned system.},

abstract = {First-order system least squares (FOSLS) is a methodology that offers an alternative to standard methods for solving partial differential equations. This paper studies the first-order system least-squares approach for scalar second-order elliptic boundary value problems with discontinuous coefficients. In a companion paper [M. Berndt, T. A. Manteuffel, S. F. McCormick, and G. Starke, Analysis of first-order system least squares (FOSLS) for elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients: Part I, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 43 (2005), pp. 386-408], ellipticity of an appropriately scaled least-squares bilinear form is established in a natural norm. For some geometries this ellipticity is independent of the size of the jumps in the coefficients. The occurrence of singularities at interface corners, cross-points, reentrant corners, and irregular boundary points is discussed, and a basis of singular functions with local support around singular points is established. This paper describes a method for including discrete versions of the singular basis functions together with standard finite element spaces in a least-squares format at little additional computational cost. The singular basis functions are constructed to match the jump conditions that arise at interfaces between regions of continuity of the diffusion coefficient. Because these basis functions must be approximated in practice, the resulting discretization is by nature nonconforming. This necessitates the establishment here of a general error estimate for FOSLS L 2 minimization problems discretized by nonconforming finite elements. An advantage of the FOSLS formulation is that this estimate does not involve the consistency error term usually present in bounds for other methods. Based on this general estimate, error bounds are derived for the finite element space that includes singular basis functions. Numerical tests are included that confirm these discretization error bounds. Finally, a multilevel method is developed for solving the discrete system that uses singular basis functions on all levels, and its efficiency is demonstrated by the numerical results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {We propose new practical adaptive refinement algorithms for conforming hp-finite element approximations of elliptic problems. We consider the use of both exact and inexact solvers within the established framework of adaptive methods consisting of four concatenated modules: SOLVE, ESTIMATE, MARK, REFINE. The strategies are driven by guaranteed equilibrated flux a posteriori error estimators. Namely, for an inexact approximation obtained by an (arbitrary) iterative algebraic solver, the bounds for the total, the algebraic, and the discretization errors are provided. The nested hierarchy of hp-finite element spaces is crucially exploited for the algebraic error upper bound which in turn allows us to formulate sharp stopping criteria for the algebraic solver. Our hp-refinement criterion hinges on from solving two local residual problems posed on patches of elements around marked vertices selected by a bulk-chasing criterion. They respectively emulate h-refinement and p-refinement. One particular feature of our approach is that we derive a computable real number which gives a guaranteed bound on the ratio of the (unknown) energy error in the next adaptive loop step with respect to the present one (i.e. on the error reduction factor). Numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed adaptive strategies. We investigate the accuracy of our bound on the error reduction factor which turns out to be excellent, with effectivity indices close to the optimal value of one. In practice, we observe asymptotic exponential convergence rates, in both the exact and inexact algebraic solver settings. Finally, we also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed strategies. We prove that under some additional assumptions on the h- and p-refinements, including the interior node property and sufficient p-refinements, the computable reduction factors are indeed bounded by a generic constant strictly smaller than one. This implies the convergence of the adaptive strategies.},

For the 2D case, we prove that the mesh-closure step of NVB, which preserves regularity of the triangulation, is quasi-optimal and that the corresponding L2-projection onto lowest-order Courant finite elements (P1-FEM) is always H1-stable. Throughout, no additional assumptions on the initial triangulation are imposed. Our analysis thus improves results of Binev, Dahmen {\&} DeVore (Numer. Math. 97, 2004), Carstensen (Constr. Approx. 20, 2004), and Stevenson (Math. Comp. 77, 2008) in the sense that all assumptions of their theorems are removed. Consequently, our results relax the requirements under which adaptive finite element schemes can be mathematically guaranteed to convergence with quasi-optimal rates.},

abstract = {Natural language place descriptions in everyday communication provide a rich source of spatial knowledge about places. An important step to utilize such knowledge in information systems is geo-referencing all the places referred to in these descriptions. Current techniques for geo-referencing places from text documents are using place name recognition and disambiguation; however, place descriptions often contain place references that are not known by gazetteers, or that are expressed in other, more flexible ways. Hence, the approach for geo-referencing presented in this paper starts from a place graph that contains the place references as well as spatial relationships extracted from place descriptions. Spatial relationships are used to constrain the locations of places and allow the later best-matching process for geo-referencing. The novel geo-referencing process results in higher precision and recall compared to state-of-art toponym resolution approaches on several tested place description datasets.},

abstract = {Adaptive Finite Element Methods for numerically solving elliptic equations are used often in practice. Only recently [12], [17] have these methods been shown to converge. However, this convergence analysis says nothing about the rates of convergence of these methods and therefore does, in principle, not guarantee yet any numerical advantages of adaptive strategies versus non-adaptive strategies. The present paper modifies the adaptive method of Morin, Nochetto, and Siebert [17] for solving the Laplace equation with piecewise linear elements on domains in R{\^{}}2 by adding a coarsening step and proves that this new method has certain optimal convergence rates in the energy norm (which is equivalent to the H1 norm). Namely, it is shown that whenever s{\textgreater} 0 and the solution u is such that for each n ≥ 1, it can be approximated to accuracy O(n{\^{}}−s) in the energy norm by a continuous, piecewise linear function on a triangulation with n cells (using complete knowledge of u), then the adaptive algorithm constructs an approximation of the same type with the same asymptotic accuracy while using only information gained during the computational process. Moreover, the number of arithmetic computations in the proposed method is also of order O(n) for each n ≥ 1. The construction and analysis of this adaptive method relies on the theory of nonlinear approximation.},

In our multigrid iterations, on each level we only perform relaxation on new nodes and the old nodes whose support of nodal basis function have changed. The convergence analysis of the algorithm is based on the framework of subspace decomposition and subspace correction. In order to decompose the functions from the finest finite element space into each level, a new projection is presented in this paper. Briefly speaking, this new projection can be seemed as the weighted average of the local L2 projection. We can perform our subspace decomposition through this new projection by its localization property. Other properties of this new projection are also presented and by these properties we prove the uniform convergence of the algorithm in both 2D and 3D. We also present some numerical examples to illustrate our conclusion.},

In our multigrid iterations, on each level we only perform relaxation on new nodes and the old nodes whose support of nodal basis function have changed. The convergence analysis of the algorithm is based on the framework of subspace decomposition and subspace correction. In order to decompose the functions from the finest finite element space into each level, a new projection is presented in this paper. Briefly speaking, this new projection can be seemed as the weighted average of the local L2 projection. We can perform our subspace decomposition through this new projection by its localization property. Other properties of this new projection are also presented and by these properties we prove the uniform convergence of the algorithm in both 2D and 3D. We also present some numerical examples to illustrate our conclusion.},

abstract = {Finite element methods find best approximations to the solution of an (elliptic) PDE by piece- wise polynomials of some fixed degree w.r.t. a partition of the domain into, say, triangles. Adaptive finite elements produce a sequence of such approximations where each next approxi- mation is constructed from the previous one by refining the partition there where the current error turns out to be large. This error is estimated locally by an a posteriori error estimator. Adaptive finite elements are the topic of an MSc. course taught at KdVI. Adaptive hp-finite element methods go one step further, in the sense that not only the partition is adapted to the unknown solution, but also the polynomial degree on the individual triangles. They aim to achieve an exponential convergence rate in terms of the number of degrees of freedom, equal to the rate of a best sequence of hp-partitions for this (unknown) solution. Convergence theory of hp-finite elements is the center of current interest in the finite element community. Besides the difficulties associated with any adaptive method handling locally refined par- titions, an implementation requires dealing with polynomials of an (a priorily) unbounded degree whose bases moreover vary from triangle to triangle. The data structures involved in this algorithm requires one to develop specialized computational methods, which we will cover in depth.},

abstract = {There is a simple and overflow-robust formula for computing binomial coefficients that I learned many, o so many years ago, but that I keep forgetting so often that I finally decided to put it on paper. One of the problems of the computation of binomial coefficient is that if you are too nave about it, you will end up with overflows. For instance, you want to compute 1000 999 (1) The value of this coefficient is 1000, which is well within the representation capabilities of a computer, but if you try to compute it the nave way, according to the definition 1000 999 = 1000! 999! (1000 − 999)! (2) you will have to start by computing 1000!, which, as far as I know, no computer today can represent. However, write the generic coefficient as n k = n! n! (n − k)! = 1 {\textperiodcentered} 2 {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} n (1 {\textperiodcentered} 2 {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} k)(1 {\textperiodcentered} 2 {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} (n − k)) = (k + 1) {\textperiodcentered} (k + 2) {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} n 1 {\textperiodcentered} 2 {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} (n − k) (3) where we have used the k! to eliminate the first k factors of n!. This we can write as (k + 1) {\textperiodcentered} (k + 2) {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} n 1 {\textperiodcentered} 2 {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} (n − k) = (k + 1) {\textperiodcentered} (k + 2) {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} k + n − k 1 {\textperiodcentered} 2 {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} (n − k) = k + 1 1 {\textperiodcentered} k + 2 2 {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} k + (n − k) n − k (4) that is, n k = n−k i=1 k + i i == n−k i=1 1 + k i (5) The nice property of this formulation is that it is a product of factors all greater than 1, which guarantees that the result will be monotonically increasing until it reaches the final result. This guarantees that, provided the final result does not cause an overflow, there will be no overflows along the way. To have a more efficient computation, we can notice that the binomial formula is symmetric in k and n − k so that we can write a similar formula in n − k: n k = k i=1 1 + n − k i (6) It is convenient, of course, to use always the product with the fewer factors, so we can write the procedure as 1},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a general adaptive finite element framework for unstruc-tured tetrahedral meshes without hanging nodes suitable for large scale parallel computations. Our framework is designed to scale linearly to several thousands of processors, using fully distributed and efficient algorithms. The key components of our implementation, local mesh refinement and load balancing algorithms, are described in detail. Finally, we present a theoretical and experimental performance study of our framework, used in a large scale computational fluid dynamics computa-tion, and we compare scaling and complexity of different algorithms on different massively parallel architectures. 1. Introduction. Adaptive mesh refinement methods are effective techniques used for reducing computational cost of a finite element based solver. By using er-ror indicators, an adaptive solver can add more elements in regions of interest, for instance, where the local error is large, hence locally enhancing the resolution of a solution with minimal extra computational cost. However, for most computationally demanding large scale problems, these reductions are often not enough, and they are still too computationally expensive for ordinary computers. By utilizing parallel computing one could gain access to the large amounts of memory and processors demanded by, for example, complex flow problems. Despite all the work in the field of adaptive finite element methods (FEMs) most of this work could not easily be applied in the parallel setting, mostly due to the distributed memory model required by most larger message passing parallel computers. As mentioned, the main obstacle toward an adaptive parallel finite element solver is the distributed memory model, which adds additional constraints on both solver and mesh refinement methods. This paper addresses the problem of adaptive refinement of unstructured tetrahedral meshes without hanging nodes. Most state-of-the-art finite element packages with support for parallel processing bypass this problem by distributing the entire mesh to all processors, assigning parts of the mesh to each processor [19, 2]. This lowers computational time but not memory requirements. In this paper, we present a fully distributed adaptive solver framework where all components, assembly, error estimation, refinement, and load balancing are scalable to thousands of processors in parallel with fully distributed data.

Our analysis is effective for all conforming ￼ m elements which covers both the two- and three-dimensional cases in a unified fashion.},

abstract = {Two space-time variational formulations of linear parabolic evolution equations are considered, one is symmetric and elliptic on the trial space while the other is not. In each case, a space-time Petrov--Galerkin discretization using suitable tensor product trial and test functions leads to a large linear system of equations. The well-posedness of this system with respect to parabolic norms induces a canonical preconditioner for the algebraic equations that arise after a choice of basis. For the iterative resolution of this algebraic system with parallelization in the temporal direction we propose a sparse algebraic wavelet-in-time transformation on possibly nonuniform temporal meshes. This transformation approximately block-diagonalizes the preconditioner, and the individual spatial blocks can then be inverted for instance by standard spatial multigrid methods in parallel. The performance of the preconditioner is documented in a series of numerical experiments.},

abstract = {One hundred years after the introduction of the Bernstein polynomial basis, we survey the historical development and current state of theory, algorithms, and applications associated with this remarkable method of representing polynomials over finite domains. Originally introduced by Sergei Natanovich Bernstein to facilitate a constructive proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem, the leisurely convergence rate of Bernstein polynomial approximations to continuous functions caused them to languish in obscurity, pending the advent of digital computers. With the desire to exploit the power of computers for geometric design applications, however, the Bernstein form began to enjoy widespread use as a versatile means of intuitively constructing and manipulating geometric shapes, spurring further development of basic theory, simple and efficient recursive algorithms, recognition of its excellent numerical stability properties, and an increasing diversification of its repertoire of applications. This survey provides a brief historical perspective on the evolution of the Bernstein polynomial basis, and a synopsis of the current state of associated algorithms and applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The approach has similarity to the residual method but differs from it in the use of norms of negative Sobolev spaces corresponding to the given bilinear (energy) form. For clarity the presentation is restricted to one-dimensional model problems. More specifically, the source, eigenvalue, and parabolic problems are considered involving a linear, self-adjoint operator of the second order. Generalizations to more general one-dimensional problems are straightforward, and the results also extend to higher space dimensions; but this involves some additional considerations. The estimates can be used for a practical a-posteriori assessment of the accuracy of a computed finite element solution, and they provide a basis for the design of adaptive finite element solvers.},

abstract = {The adaptive tensor product wavelet Galerkin method is a well-known method for solving linear well-posed operator equations on product domains. For a wide class of operators this method can be shown to be of optimal computational complexity and to converge at the best possible rate w.r.t. the underlying tensor product wavelet basis. We focus on new domain types to which this method can be applied and on the improvement of quantitative aspects. As a first part, the adaptive tensor product wavelet Galerkin method is extended to linear operator problems on unbounded domains. In particular, it is shown that the method maintains its optimality w.r.t. computational complexity and convergence rate. As a second part, we present a fast algorithm for the application of finite dimensional system matrices arising from the tensor product wavelet discretization of the underlying linear operator. This algorithm is shown to be of linear complexity for a large class of local operators and, in particular, does not require compressions of the system matrix. Furthermore, a new efficient way of approximate residual evaluation within the adaptive tensor product wavelet Galerkin method is developed. The corresponding algorithm for the residual approximation is based on the aforementioned fast evaluation of system matrices and leads to a significant improvement of the performance of the adaptive tensor product wavelet Galerkin method. Theoretical findings are underlined by various numerical experiments. Moreover, the application of the adaptive tensor product wavelet Galerkin method to partial integrodifferential equations arising in L{\'{e}}vy models in finance is discussed using selected examples.},

abstract = {This paper is a contemporary review of QMC (‘quasi-Monte Carlo') methods, that is, equal-weight rules for the approximate evaluation of high-dimensional integrals over the unit cube [0,1] s , where s may be large, or even infinite. After a general introduction, the paper surveys recent developments in lattice methods, digital nets, and related themes. Among those recent developments are methods of construction of both lattices and digital nets, to yield QMC rules that have a prescribed rate of convergence for sufficiently smooth functions, and ideally also guaranteed slow growth (or no growth) of the worst-case error as s increases. A crucial role is played by parameters called ‘weights', since a careful use of the weight parameters is needed to ensure that the worst-case errors in an appropriately weighted function space are bounded, or grow only slowly, as the dimension s increases. Important tools for the analysis are weighted function spaces, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and discrepancy, all of which are discussed with an appropriate level of detail.},
